{data}

## Response:

<>Formatted Prompt:
formated_prompt NOT SET

<>Formatted Response:
Based on the given context, the DataFrame provided contains information about different files. Each row represents a file and includes the following columns: duration, amount_sent, and average_bandwidth. The "duration" column represents the duration of each file in seconds. The "amount_sent" column represents the amount of data sent by each file in bytes. The "average_bandwidth" column represents the average bandwidth used by each file in Mbps.
